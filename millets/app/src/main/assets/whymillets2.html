    This translates to very little returns in terms of economics for farmers cultivating these millets.

Even in areas where millets are produced in quite appreciable quantities, very few families consume millets.
        There is a rich cultural background and culinary heritage of millets in nearly every corner of the world that have almost
        vanished in the last couple of decades. Increasing the status of millets locally and globally would go a long way in reviving
        traditional millets and moving towards a more sustainable food chain system.
        It is also required to popularize that all the millets can now be processed without tedious and tiring manual operations.
        Proper nutrition and Sound exercise are critical elements for a healthy life. So promoting and popularizing millets is a natural collaboration
        to sustain a <em> healthy lifestyle.</em>
