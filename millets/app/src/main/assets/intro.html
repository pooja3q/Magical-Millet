    By any nutritional parameter,
    millets are miles ahead of <em> rice and wheat </em> in terms of their mineral content.
    In this fashion, nutrient to nutrient,
    every single millet is <em> extraordinarily superior </em> to <i>rice and wheat</i> and
    therefore is the solution for the malnutrition that affects a vast majority of the Indian population.
