<li><b>Millets</b> helps to lower blood glucose levels and improves insulin response. Besides,<i> the magnesium present
</i>in millets is a co-factor in various enzymes involved in the secretion of insulin and metabolism of glucose in the body.
    Whole grains improve insulin sensitivity by lowering glycemic index of the diet by increasing content of fibre, magnesium and vitamin-E.
<li><b>Glycemic Index</b> is a scale that ranks carbohydrates by how much they raise the blood glucose levels compared to
        a reference food.
        Millets have a low Glycemic index compared to most other cereals. Since millets have a low Glycemic
        index they increase satiety by decreasing hunger because it slows the rate of digestion.
<li><b>Millets</b> are a rich source of <em>phosphorus</em> which is an important mineral for energy production and is an essential component of ATP - the energy store of the body.
        It also forms an essential part of nervous system and cell membranes.
<li><b>Millet</b> is such a grain that should be included in the list of <em>heart-healthy </em>
        choices because of its status as a good source of magnesium.<i> Magnesium </i>increases insulin sensitivity and lowers
        triglycerides. It also acts as a co-factor for more than 300 enzymes.
<li><b>Lignans</b> present in millets are converted to mammalian lignans and entero-lactone by the healthy gut micro flora in our body which is thought
        to protect against <em>breast cancer as well as heart diseases.</em>
<li><b>Millets</b> have amazing <em>fatty acid profiles</em>.
        One might have heard about rice bran oil - the oil extracted from the bran of paddy rice.
<li><b>The fatty acid </b>content in each of the millets is much higher than that in paddy or
        wheat and the composition of the fatty acids are way more beneficial than what is found in paddy.
        One has to keep in mind an important aspect of cereal grains - almost all the mineral and fatty acids and a good proportion of the fibre content is found in the bran layer. So one needs to make sure that the millet grains are unpolished, sometimes also referred to as whole grain millet rice, and have suffered minimal bran loss. Polishing millets removes the bran layer leading to major loss of nutrients. But it makes the over-all processing easier and allows for larger scale processing
