<em>Millets</em> have also played an important role in <em>nurturing soils</em> and
    improving their fertility and texture, thereby increasing the yield and
    hence the returns to the farmer. Once the root system is established,
    millets can survive many dry weeks. Once it starts raining,
    the plants jump back to life and yield something by the end of the season.
    Millets are thus fairly effective at aggregating nutrients.
    If we are conscious in closing the nutrient loop locally,
    we can realize a manifold increase in soil health.
    Millets are thus <i>environmentally, ecologically, economically friendly</i> sources of food and nutrition.
