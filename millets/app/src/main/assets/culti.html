   <b> Millets </b>are known to be <em>farmer friendly cultivars.</em>
In many communities, millets are considered the <i>'unconcerned cultivator's crop'!</i>
    Farmers really need to do just two things in a season:
    go to the field to sow seeds and then return after 3 months to harvest the grains.
    Millets need almost no inputs, grow even in extremely less fertile soils, don't need deep ploughing,
    can be sown with minimal tools or machines. With timely and good rains at the right time,
    the farmer can expect a good harvest. Using some improved agricultural techniques and
    practices, farmers can get a good harvest even when the rains are not up to mark.
Most of the millet cultivation takes place in the <em>Kharif period,</em> i.e. during the monsoon season.
    In areas that receive more than <i>800mm of rains</i>, many of the millets
    can be cultivated in the second season, i.e. as a <em>Rabi cro
    p </em>(during the post monsoon, early winter months).
    And in some places with the right soil and geography,
    a few millets can even grow in the third season, during the dark days of winter,
    drawing on residual moisture in the soil and the dew that precipitates.
