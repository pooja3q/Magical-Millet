    Millets are extremely hardy crops like <em>Proso millet</em> that requires approximately 70 days only for harvesting.
<br>
    This property of short cultivation tenure is the reason that probably made millets the <em>staple grain</em> of the communities across Central Asia,
    and also enabled them to spread far as these communities moved from one place to another place.
If we compare millets with other major cereals to other cereal grains, first do not ask much from the <em>soil and climate </em> and
    are not susceptible to pests either in the field or during storage. Considering how likely it would be that
    early humans would be able to access dry, rain fed lands as compared to wetlands, and
    it becomes apparent that millets would be the go-to-grain to meet dietary needs.
    In fact, as we move forward in time, we see that as agricultural communities were able to avail of irrigation,
    more and more of them have lost out on their millet heritage.
    In India, millets continue to be a significant part (but eroding fast) of tribal communities.
