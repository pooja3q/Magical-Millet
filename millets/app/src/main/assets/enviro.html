    <b>Millets</b> have emerged to survive in extremely rough climatic conditions
    without any need for human intervention. But so far,
    most varieties developed have preserved this characteristic,
    adapting them to thrive in fairly diverse environments.
    In the current situation of worsening conditions due to climate change,
    it is these features that have brought millets back into the focus of researchers and
    policy makers seeking to develop a more sustainable food system.
<i>Millets </i>being rain fed crops do not require standing water in their fields,
    so there is no need for big dams to be built; ecology to be disrupted by reservoirs;
    elaborate canal systems to be created to get water to the farms etc.
    Millets do not need any fertility enhancement or pesticides, insecticides to grow well and
    yield a good harvest. Millets are extremely nutritious grains.
    Their high nutrient content makes them desirable not just to humans, but also to birds and other animals too.
