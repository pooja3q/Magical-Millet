    <b>The</b> three most widely available millets in the market place today:-
    <ul type="arrow">
        <li>Sorghum
        <li>Pearl millet
        <li>Finger millet - <i>are naked grains, i.e. do not have a husk layer.</i>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <i>Processing </i>these for human consumption is essentially a matter of cleaning and grading the grains.
    They are then ground up to either their flour form or into grits making them ready for cooking.
    This ease of processing is one of the reasons for these grains to persist in the local communities' diets.
    There are six other commonly cultivated millets -<i> Foxtail, Little, Kodo, Proso, Barnyard, and Brown Top </i>-
    that have a hard cellulosic husk layer that humans cannot digest.
    Together they are sometimes referred to as small millets.
    The removal of the husk layer thus becomes the primary task of processing these grains.
    Once removed, we get the respective millets' rice, i.e.
    foxtail millet rice, little millet rice, kodo millet rice, proso millet rice, barnyard millet rice and brown top millet rice.
    These millet rices are then used in preparations in the same form and method that paddy rice is used in different cuisines.
To remove the husk from the grain, one can use two forces -<i> impact or shear.</i>
    A<i> stone grinding mill</i>- manual or <i>motor powered</i>-employs shear force
    while <i>manual pounding or centrifugal hulling machines</i> use impact force.
    Large scale processing of small millets compromises the nutritional value of the millet rice output
    by removing the bran layer completely.
    But the pest infestation problem continues to be severe
    and most processors resort to chemical methods of cleaning their products pest free.
